# Platform-Testing
Insights about the less explored ground.

Platform Testing - Most of us have heard this before with the words exactly switched over. Interestingly, I encountered the term in it's actual sense while exploring something else and thought of putting it forward.
Most of us have heard of various terminologies combined with testing and have known them in theory and practice.
But 'Platform Testing' is that less known ground which is the foundation of the outer building, that most of us have visited so far.
We know about UI testing, API testing, browser Testing, and so on... but have we ever explored how the technical teams instate the platform to be used for achieving the purpose?
The answer is Platform Testing - An underlying testing exercise that ensures errorproof functioning of the platform to be used as a product by the engineering team, working towards delivery to the end market.
Here the customer is the software development team and platform engineers are the service provider.
With no facing toward the customer, platform engineers are the show-stoppers behind the stage who provide the building blocks of the various front-end tools. 
The stake is high with them as they are the ones ensuring a high-performance, secure, and reliable ecosystem for the engineering team.

The area is demanding as it asks to walk ahead of the prospects and be aligned by high degrees.

Hope you find it insightful ℹ️
